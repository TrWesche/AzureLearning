  - In Frameworks such as Python / Node.js
- Web Jobs Can Be Deployed:
  - Via source control (i.e. GIT)
  - FTP
  - Visual Studio
  - CI/CD tools (ex. Azure DevOps Services)
- Web Job Types
  - Continuous (ex. use case - polling a message queue)

- Web Jobs and Azure Functions are very similar, Azure Functions are effectively successors of Web Jobs however Web Jobs still have some benefits:
  - Azure Functions: More flexible and scalable, maintained separately
  - Web Jobs: Can be deployed and maintained alongside website code, easier to maintain
- Web Jobs require the web app to be set to always on to operate properly.  This can be achieved with the following command in the Azure CLI (replace WEB_APP_ID with the proper value):
  - az webapp config set --id $WEB_APP_ID --always-on true
